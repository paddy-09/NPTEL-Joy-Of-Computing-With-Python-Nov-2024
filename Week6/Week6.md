1. **If n is a positive integer, what is the output of the function given input n,**
   <todo>

    &#9679; Sum of numbers from 1 to n
   
    &#9679; Sum of numbers from 1 to n-1
   
    &#9679; n-1

    &#9679; n :white_check_mark:
     
3. **Which of the following are true about recursion?**
   
    &#9679; Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine. :white_check_mark:

    &#9679; Recursion is a better alternative for performing repetitive tasks compared to iteration.
   
    &#9679; Recursion requires more resources compared to iteration. :white_check_mark:

5. **What is the output of following code ?**
    <todo>
    &#9679; 10 
 
    &#9679; 8 :white_check_mark:

    &#9679; 5 

    &#9679; Error 

7. **The letter 'e' is the most frequently occurring letter in the English language. Suppose we apply a Substitution Cipher where 'e' is mapped to 'a', and all other letters are uniquely mapped to different letters. If we encrypt a very long English storybook using this cipher, will the frequency of 'a' be the highest in the encrypted text?
<br/>
Hint: Search the internet for more info, if needed** 
     
    &#9679; Yes, it would be same as ’e’ in the original text :white_check_mark: 
 
    &#9679; Yes, it would be higher than ’e’ in the original text.
   
    &#9679; No, it would be lower than ’e’ in the original text.

    &#9679; No, we cannot predict
   
9. **Could we check frequency of letters in a long ciphertext and map them to frequency of letters in English to decrypt the message?
<br/>
Hint: Search the internet for more info, if needed.**
 
    &#9679; Yes, it is possible. :white_check_mark: 

    &#9679; No, it is not possible.
   
7. **What are drawbacks of using frequency analysis to decrypt a message that has been encrypted using Substitution Cipher?** 
     
    &#9679; Y It will not work if the cipher text is too small. :white_check_mark: 
 
    &#9679; It works flawlessly.
   
    &#9679; It will not work if the encrypted text was previously encrypted using a different cipher, which could have removed patterns in common English. :white_check_mark: 

    &#9679;  The frequency analysis method doesn’t work at all for Substitution Cipher

7. **If variable dict name is a non-empty dictionary, what does dict name.keys() return?** 
     
    &#9679; Returns nothing, but prints all the keys in the dictionary.
 
    &#9679; Returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary. :white_check_mark: 
   
    &#9679; Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary. 

    &#9679; Returns a list of all the items in the dictionary

7. **Is Ceaser Cipher a type of Substitution Cipher?** 
     
    &#9679; Yes :white_check_mark: 
 
    &#9679; No 

7. **What is the consequence of not having a base case in a recursive function?** 
     
    &#9679; The function will run infinitely. :white_check_mark: 
 
    &#9679; The function will run only once.
   
    &#9679; The function will not run at all.

    &#9679; The function will run only for a fixed number of times.

7. **What are the number of possible final lines when someone wins, in a game of TicTac-Toe?** 
     
    &#9679;  3 
 
    &#9679; 8 :white_check_mark: 
   
    &#9679; 9
   
    &#9679; 4
