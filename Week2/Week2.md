    &#9679; **while** loop :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; **for** loop
    
    &#9679; **do-while** loop
    
    &#9679; **while-range** loop

10. **What happens when the condition inside the if and while evaluate to false ?**
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter ignores the if/while blocks, and halts the program. 
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter ignores the if/while blocks, and proceeds the program from the lines after the if/while block. :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter executes the if/while blocks, and rest of the program.
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter executes the if/while, and the programs runs in an infinite loop.

    &#9679; No, the program doesn’t have infinite loop.
    
    &#9679;  Yes, it can be prevented by updating the value of a before the if block at line 3. :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; Yes, it can be prevented by removing both the if blocks inside the while loop.
    
    &#9679;  Yes, but it cannot be prevented
