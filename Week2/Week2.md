    &#9679; float(input()) :white_check_mark:  
   
    &#9679; int(input())
    
    &#9679;  a = input() <br/>
             a = int(a)

7. **The following program outputs 722 -**
   <todo>

    &#9679; Calculates the factorial of a.
   
    &#9679; Calculates the factorial of a and adds 2.
   
    &#9679; Calculates the a multiples of a starting from 1 and adds 2.

10. **Which loop is used to perform a set of repetitive tasks based on condition in Python?**
    
    &#9679; **while** loop :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; **for** loop
    
    &#9679; **do-while** loop
    
    &#9679; **while-range** loop

10. **What happens when the condition inside the if and while evaluate to false ?**
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter ignores the if/while blocks, and halts the program. 
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter ignores the if/while blocks, and proceeds the program from the lines after the if/while block. :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter executes the if/while blocks, and rest of the program.
    
    &#9679; Python interpreter executes the if/while, and the programs runs in an infinite loop.

10. **The following program might/might not have an infinite loop. Does the program have infinite loop ?**
    <todo>

    &#9679; No, the program doesn’t have infinite loop.
    
    &#9679;  Yes, it can be prevented by updating the value of a before the if block at line 3. :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; Yes, it can be prevented by removing both the if blocks inside the while loop.
    
    &#9679;  Yes, but it cannot be prevented
