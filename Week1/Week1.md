1. **The cat wants to move 100 steps away slowly, and by the time it finishes moving 100 steps, it needs to slowly rotate as well towards the opposite direction. Can both these tasks be accomplished by using a single loop in Scratch?**
    &#9679; Yes :white_check_mark:
   
    &#9679; No

2. **Which block moves the cat as described in the previous question?**

    &#9679; Says the number 4, for 1 second, 10 times and changes the value of the number variable by multiplying the previous value with 4.  
    &#9679; Says the number 4, for 1 second, 10 times and changes the value of the number variable by adding the previous value with 4.  
    &#9679; Says the number 4, and its multiples each for 1 second, till 40, and changes the value of the number variable by multiplying the previous value with 4.  
    &#9679; Says the number 4, and its multiples each for 1 second, till 40, and changes the value of the number variable by adding the previous value with 4. :white_check_mark:  

6. **From the previous question, what is the value of the number variable after the loop ends?**
    &#9679; 40  
    &#9679; 44 :white_check_mark:  
    &#9679; 36  
    &#9679; 4
