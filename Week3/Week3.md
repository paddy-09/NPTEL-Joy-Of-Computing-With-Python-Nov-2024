1. **Which of the following is/are true statement(s)?**

    &#9679; Lists are used to store multiple values. :white_check_mark:

    &#9679; One can access element in list by using non-numeric indices. 

    &#9679; Iterating over lists is possible in Python. :white_check_mark:

    &#9679; We need to specify required size of list while creating a new list variable.
     
3. **In the below code -** <br/>
     <todo>
     **For what value of n does the program print 21 ?**
     Accepted Answer (Type: Numeric) 7

5. **From the previous question, for what values of n is the number 7 appended to list a.**
   
    &#9679; 7 
 
    &#9679; 6  
   
    &#9679; 8 :white_check_mark:  
    
    &#9679; 9 :white_check_mark:  

7. **What does the following code perform ?** <br/>
  <todo>
    &#9679; It converts any input list into a new list which is filled with some alternative even and odd numbers.
   
    &#9679; It converts any input list into a new list such that at even indices, the value is a multiple of an even number and at odd indices, the value is either odd or even number. :white_check_mark:
   
    &#9679; It converts any input list into a new list such that at even indices, the value is multiple of 2 and at odd indices, the value is multiple of 3.
   
    &#9679; It converts any input list into a new list, which follows no pattern.

9. **From the previous question, if the option -
"It converts any input list into a new list which is filled with some alternative even and odd numbers."
is incorrect, Can you make changes to code such that this option is true ?**
 
    &#9679; No, it is not possible to make such changes.
   
    &#9679; No, the option is already correct.
   
    &#9679; Yes, we can make changes. :white_check_mark:

11. **If file.txt exists, Does the code successfully run ?**
    <todo>
    
    &#9679; Yes 
    
    &#9679; No :white_check_mark:

10. **Which of the following are examples of Social Computing ?**
    
    &#9679; StackOverflow :white_check_mark:  
 
    &#9679; Wikipedia :white_check_mark:  
   
    &#9679; Quora :white_check_mark:  
    
    &#9679; None 

10. **What does the following code print for n = 3?**
    <todo>
    
    &#9679; WE KNOW THE WISDOM OF SERIES :white_check_mark:  
 
    &#9679; WE ARE YET TO KNOW MANY THINGS

10. **From the previous question, is the variable n or a.sort() responsible for printing of either of the two possible sentences ?**
    
    &#9679; No, it is not dependent on variable n, the code will never print ”WE ARE YET TO KNOW MANY THINGS”. :white_check_mark:  
 
    &#9679; Yes on a.sort() only, but the code will never print ”WE ARE YET TO KNOW MANY THINGS”.
    
    &#9679; Yes on both, the code may print both sentences.
    
    &#9679; No, it is not dependent on a.sort(), the code will never print ”WE ARE YET TO KNOW MANY THINGS”.

11. What does the code in question 8, calculate ?<br/>
Can you say what the values of k and b are if n = 10294343763482 x 102309.<br/>
If values of k and b are different, enter 0, else enter value of k <br/>
