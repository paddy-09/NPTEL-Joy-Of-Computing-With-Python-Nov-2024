11. **Calculate the magic constant for 4x4 square, where all elements are distinct numbers from 1 to 16, is it same as the magic constant for Ramanujan’s magic square ?**<br/>

    **If yes, enter 0, else enter the absolute difference between the two.
    Hint: Search the about Ramanujan’s magic square.** <br/>

    &#9679; Calculate factorial of number n. 
 
    &#9679; Calculate factors of number n.

    &#9679; Calculate prime factors of number n.

    &#9679; Calculate factors of number n excluding n. :white_check_mark:
    
10. **For what n1,n2 flag will the variable flag inside function2() be not equal to true ?**
    
    &#9679; 2,3
 
    &#9679; 0,0 :white_check_mark:

    &#9679; 1,1 :white_check_mark:

    &#9679; 1,0 :white_check_mark:

10. **If all possible pairs of prime numbers between 0 and 20, are given to n1 and n2, for how many pairs would function2 print ”Completed” ?**
    
    &#9679; It will not print ”Completed” for any pair.
 
    &#9679; It will print ”Completed” only for pairs (2,3)(3,5),(2,5), and for the remaining it would not print ”Completed”.

    &#9679; It will print ”Completed” only for pair (2,3), and for the remaining other pairs of primes it would not print ”Completed”.
    
    &#9679; It will print ”Completed” for all pairs of primes between 0 and 20. :white_check_mark:

10. **If numbers of pairs of primes which result in function2 to print ”Completed” are greater than 0, Can we edit the code in function2() so that ”Completed” is never printed for any pair of primes ?**
    
    &#9679; Yes, we can change the logic for setting flag variable to True.
 
    &#9679; Yes, we can change/increase the threshold for length of list2 in the last if block. :white_check_mark:
    
    &#9679; No, it is logically not possible.
    
    &#9679; Yes, we can change the initial value of flag to True, instead of False.
